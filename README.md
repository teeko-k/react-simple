# React Simple creator

This package aims at creating a simple project setup for [React](https://reactjs.org). It is inspired by and supposed to work as an alternative for [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install

1 - You can use _react simple creator_ with **npx**. To create a new react project in a folder called `app-folder` just type the following and your project will be set up.

```bash
npx react-simple-creator folder-name
cd app-folder
```

2 - Installation can be global

```bash
npm install -g react-simple-creator
```

then you can type

```bash
react-simple-creator app-folder
cd app-folder
```

## Run App

to start the development server simply type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That should start a `localhost` server at port `3000`
